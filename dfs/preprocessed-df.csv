"['You happen to know that Tim and Harry have recently had a terrible row that ended their friendship. Now someone tells you that she just saw Tim and Harry jogging together. The best explanation for this that you can think of is that they made up. You conclude that they are friends again.\n One morning you enter the kitchen to find a plate and cup on the table, with breadcrumbs and a pat of butter on it, and surrounded by a jar of jam, a pack of sugar, and an empty carton of milk. You conclude that one of your house-mates got up at night to make him- or herself a midnight snack and was too tired to clear the table. This, you think, best explains the scene you are facing. To be sure, it might be that someone burgled the house and took the time to have a bite while on the job, or a house-mate might have arranged the things on the table without having a midnight snack but just to make you believe that someone had a midnight snack. But these hypotheses strike you as providing much more contrived explanations of the data than the one you infer to.\n Walking along the beach, you see what looks like a picture of Winston Churchill in the sand. It could be that, as in the opening pages of Hilary Putnam’s book Reason, Truth, and History, , what you see is actually the trace of an ant crawling on the beach. The much simpler, and therefore (you think) much better, explanation is that someone intentionally drew a picture of Churchill in the sand. That, in any case, is what you come away believing.\n In these examples, the conclusions do not follow logically from the premises. For instance, it does not follow logically that Tim and Harry are friends again from the premises that they had a terrible row which ended their friendship and that they have just been seen jogging together; it does not even follow, we may suppose, from all the information you have about Tim and Harry. Nor do you have any useful statistical data about friendships, terrible rows, and joggers that might warrant an inference from the information that you have about Tim and Harry to the conclusion that they are friends again, or even to the conclusion that, probably (or with a certain probability), they are friends again. What leads you to the conclusion, and what according to a considerable number of philosophers may also warrant this conclusion, is precisely the fact that Tim and Harry’s being friends again would, if true, best explain the fact that they have just been seen jogging together. (The proviso that a hypothesis be true if it is to explain anything is taken as read from here on.) Similar remarks apply to the other two examples. The type of inference exhibited here is called abduction or, somewhat more commonly nowadays, Inference to the Best Explanation.']","That's a great question! You see, our brains are wired to look for the most plausible explanation for a given set of circumstances. In this case, the presence of dirty dishes and a cereal box suggests that someone had a meal, but the question is, who? You infer that it was your roommate because that's the most straightforward and logical explanation, given the context. It's like a puzzle: you're trying to find the piece that fits best, and in this case, the ""roommate had breakfast"" piece fits better than the ""burglar had a snack"" piece.","Professor, I was thinking about how I concluded that my roommate made breakfast yesterday just by seeing the dirty dishes and cereal box in the sink. It seemed like a pretty reasonable thing to assume, but I realized I wasn't 100% sure it was actually them. How did I really know it was my roommate and not, say, a burglar who decided to have a snack?"

This is where the concept of abduction comes in. Abduction is the process of inferring the most likely explanation for a given set of circumstances, even if it's not a logically guaranteed conclusion. In the case of the Churchill picture, you infer that someone drew it because that's the most plausible explanation, given the complexity and coherence of the image. It's unlikely that the wind and sand would randomly create a perfect picture of Churchill, so you abductively infer that someone intentionally drew it. Does that make sense?","That makes sense, I guess. But what about cases where the explanation isn't so clear-cut? Like, I saw a picture of Winston Churchill drawn in the sand on the beach the other day. How do I know someone actually drew it, and it's not just a random pattern that looks like Churchill?"

Our minds are wired to seek patterns and explanations, and we use abduction to make sense of the world. It's not always a logically airtight process, but it's a fundamental aspect of how we reason and understand the world around us.","Yeah, I think so. It's like, our brains are always trying to find a story that explains what we see, and we choose the story that's most likely to be true."
"['\n Even if it is true that we routinely rely on abductive reasoning, it may still be asked whether this practice is rational. For instance, experimental studies have shown that when people are able to think of an explanation for some possible event, they tend to overestimate the likelihood that this event will actually occur.  More telling still, Lombrozo  shows that, in some situations, people tend to grossly overrate the probability of simpler explanations compared to more complicated ones. Although these studies are not directly concerned with abduction in any of the forms discussed so far, they nevertheless suggest that taking into account explanatory considerations in one’s reasoning may not always be for the better. (It is to be noted that Lombrozo’s experiments are directly concerned with some proposals that have been made for explicating abduction in a Bayesian framework; see Section 4.) However, the most pertinent remarks about the normative status of abduction are so far to be found in the philosophical literature. This section discusses the main criticisms that have been levelled against abduction, as well as the strongest arguments that have been given in its defense.']","Well, my inquisitive student, that's a great question. You see, our minds are wired to seek simplicity, often relying on what's called ""abductive reasoning."" It's like a game of Occam's Razor: we tend to favor the explanation that requires the fewest assumptions. Think of it like a mathematical equation – the simpler the solution, the more elegant. But, does that mean it's always the best approach? Not necessarily. Consider this analogy: a master chef might use a few complex ingredients to create a harmonious dish, while a novice might oversimplify and end up with a bland meal. Sometimes, simplicity can lead to oversimplification.","Professor Phil, do we always choose the simplest explanation for a phenomenon, and is that always the best approach?"

Yes, when dealing with incomplete data, we often resort to what's known as ""inference to the best explanation"" (IBE). It's like trying to solve a puzzle with missing pieces – we fill in the gaps with the most plausible explanation, even if it's not the simplest. However, this is where things can get tricky. Research has shown that people tend to overestimate the likelihood of events based on how easily they can explain them. It's like our minds are biased toward confirming our own narratives. This raises questions about the rationality of relying on abductive reasoning, especially when it comes to estimating probabilities.","That's a great point, Professor. But what about when we're faced with limited information? Don't we tend to rely on the most plausible explanation, even if it's not the simplest?"

Yes, simplicity can sometimes lead to a lack of critical thinking. When we settle for a simple explanation, we might overlook more nuanced or complex factors at play. This is where a more Bayesian approach can come in handy – considering the probability of competing explanations and updating our beliefs accordingly. It's like refining our recipe, if you will, to account for the complexity of the situation. Your colleague's concern highlights the importance of balancing simplicity with a critical evaluation of alternative explanations.","That reminds me of a conversation I had with a colleague about the importance of considering alternative explanations. They argued that simplicity can sometimes lead to a kind of ""explanatory laziness."" Do you think that's a valid concern?"

The critics of abduction, like some of the authors mentioned in this text, argue that our reliance on explanatory considerations can lead to errors and biases. However, proponents of abduction would counter that it's still a valuable tool, as long as we're aware of its limitations. It's like using a hammer – it's a great tool for driving nails, but not so much for screwing in light bulbs. We need to be aware of when and how to apply abductive reasoning, and to continually update our understanding based on new evidence. By acknowledging its limitations and being mindful of our own biases, I think we can defend abduction as a rational approach, albeit a nuanced one.","I see what you mean, Professor. It's like we need to strike a balance between simplicity and nuance. But what about the critics of abduction who argue that it's not always a rational approach? How do we respond to those concerns?"
"['\n The Buddha’s discourses collected in the Āgamas/Nikāyas analyze sentient experience from different standpoints: in terms of name-and-form (nāma-rūpa), the five aggregates (Skt., skandha, Pali, khandha), the twelve sense fields (āyatana), or the eighteen sense elements (dhātu). All these modes of analysis provide descriptions of sentient experience as a succession of physical and mental processes that arise and cease subject to various causes and conditions. A striking difference between the Sūtrānta and the Abhidharma worldviews is that the Abhidharma reduces the time scale of these processes so they are now seen as operating from moment to moment. Put differently, the Abhidharma reinterprets the terms by which the sūtras portray sequential processes as applying to discrete, momentary events .\n These events are referred to as dharmas (Pali, dhammas), differently from the singular dharma/dhamma that signifies the Buddha’s teaching(s). The Āgamas/Nikāyas use the form dharmas to convey a pluralistic representation of encountered phenomena, i.e., all sensory phenomena of whatever nature as we experience them through the six sense faculties (the five ordinary physical senses plus mind ). The canonical Abhidharma treatises, however, draw subtle distinctions within the scope of the mental and marginalize the differences between multiple varieties of mental capacities. Within this context, dharmas are seen as the objects of a specific mental capacity called mental cognitive awareness (Skt., manovijñāṇa, Pali, manoviññāṇa) that is considered the central cognitive operation in the process of sensory perception. Mental cognitive awareness is a particular type of consciousness that discerns between the stimuli impinging upon the sense faculties and that emerges when the requisite conditions come together. Dharmas are not merely mental objects like ideas, concepts, or memories. Rather, as the objects of mental cognitive awareness, dharmas may be rendered apperceptions: rapid consciousness-types (citta) that arise and cease in sequential streams, each having its own object, and that interact with the five externally directed sensory modalities (visual, auditory, etc.) of cognitive awareness. The canonical Abhidharma texts portray dharmas, then, as psycho-physical events with diverse capacities by means of which the mind unites and assimilates a particular perception, especially one newly presented, to a larger set or mass of ideas already possessed, thus comprehending and conceptualizing  it.\n Ultimately, dharmas are all that there is: all experiential events are understood as arising from the interaction of dharmas. While the analogy of atoms may be useful here, dharmas notably embrace both physical and mental phenomena, and are generally understood as evanescent events, occurrences, or dynamic properties rather than enduring  substances.  The Abhidharma exegesis thus attempts to provide an exhaustive account of every possible type of experience—every type of occurrence that may possibly present itself in one’s consciousness—in terms of its constituent dharmas. This enterprise involves breaking down the objects of ordinary perception into their constituent, discrete dharmas and clarifying their relations of causal conditioning. The overarching inquiry subsuming both the analysis of dharmas into multiple categories and their synthesis into a unified structure by means of their manifold relationships of causal conditioning is referred to as the “dharma theory.”']","Ah, you're onto something. Think of a movie. A movie appears to be a continuous flow of images, but in reality, it's just a series of individual frames, each one static, that create the illusion of movement when played in rapid succession. Similarly, Buddhist thinkers like the Abhidharma suggest that our experience of reality is composed of discrete, momentary events or 'dharmas.' These dharmas are the building blocks of our perception, and they arise and cease rapidly, giving us the impression of a continuous reality.","Professor Phil, I was reading this book about Buddhism and it said that reality is made up of tiny, fleeting moments.

Think of it like a conversation – the words I speak (physical phenomenon) and the meaning you understand (mental phenomenon) are not separate things, but are intimately connected and arise together as a single event. By analyzing reality into its constituent dharmas, we can begin to see how our experiences – both physical and mental – are intertwined and interdependent.","That makes sense, I think. But what about the idea that these dharmas are not just physical events, but also mental ones? How does that work?"
"['\n The Buddha’s discourses collected in the Āgamas/Nikāyas analyze sentient experience from different standpoints: in terms of name-and-form (nāma-rūpa), the five aggregates (Skt., skandha, Pali, khandha), the twelve sense fields (āyatana), or the eighteen sense elements (dhātu). All these modes of analysis provide descriptions of sentient experience as a succession of physical and mental processes that arise and cease subject to various causes and conditions. A striking difference between the Sūtrānta and the Abhidharma worldviews is that the Abhidharma reduces the time scale of these processes so they are now seen as operating from moment to moment. Put differently, the Abhidharma reinterprets the terms by which the sūtras portray sequential processes as applying to discrete, momentary events .\n These events are referred to as dharmas (Pali, dhammas), differently from the singular dharma/dhamma that signifies the Buddha’s teaching(s). The Āgamas/Nikāyas use the form dharmas to convey a pluralistic representation of encountered phenomena, i.e., all sensory phenomena of whatever nature as we experience them through the six sense faculties (the five ordinary physical senses plus mind ). The canonical Abhidharma treatises, however, draw subtle distinctions within the scope of the mental and marginalize the differences between multiple varieties of mental capacities. Within this context, dharmas are seen as the objects of a specific mental capacity called mental cognitive awareness (Skt., manovijñāṇa, Pali, manoviññāṇa) that is considered the central cognitive operation in the process of sensory perception. Mental cognitive awareness is a particular type of consciousness that discerns between the stimuli impinging upon the sense faculties and that emerges when the requisite conditions come together. Dharmas are not merely mental objects like ideas, concepts, or memories. Rather, as the objects of mental cognitive awareness, dharmas may be rendered apperceptions: rapid consciousness-types (citta) that arise and cease in sequential streams, each having its own object, and that interact with the five externally directed sensory modalities (visual, auditory, etc.) of cognitive awareness. The canonical Abhidharma texts portray dharmas, then, as psycho-physical events with diverse capacities by means of which the mind unites and assimilates a particular perception, especially one newly presented, to a larger set or mass of ideas already possessed, thus comprehending and conceptualizing  it.\n Ultimately, dharmas are all that there is: all experiential events are understood as arising from the interaction of dharmas. While the analogy of atoms may be useful here, dharmas notably embrace both physical and mental phenomena, and are generally understood as evanescent events, occurrences, or dynamic properties rather than enduring  substances.  The Abhidharma exegesis thus attempts to provide an exhaustive account of every possible type of experience—every type of occurrence that may possibly present itself in one’s consciousness—in terms of its constituent dharmas. This enterprise involves breaking down the objects of ordinary perception into their constituent, discrete dharmas and clarifying their relations of causal conditioning. The overarching inquiry subsuming both the analysis of dharmas into multiple categories and their synthesis into a unified structure by means of their manifold relationships of causal conditioning is referred to as the “dharma theory.”']","The Abhidharma would say that the ultimate goal is not just understanding, but liberation. By gaining a deep understanding of how our experiences arise and how they're interconnected, we can begin to see through our habitual ways of perceiving and thinking, and develop a greater sense of freedom and clarity in our lives. It's like seeing through the illusion of the movie – once we understand the individual frames that make it up, we can begin to see the world in a new and more profound way.","Okay, I think I'm starting to get it. But what's the ultimate goal of all this analysis? Is it just to understand how the world works, or is there something more to it?"
"['What is an ability? On one reading, this question is a demand for a theory of ability of the sort described above.

Think of it like this: when we say someone has the ability to play the guitar, we're not just talking about the physical actions involved, like pressing strings or strumming. We're also talking about the underlying capacity to understand music, to learn, and to create music on the guitar. It's like a bundle of skills and knowledge that allow someone to do something. But, what exactly is that bundle? Is it just a collection of things we can do, or is it something more?","Professor Phil, I've been wondering, how do we define something as an ability? I mean, what makes something we can do an ability?"

Some philosophers argue that abilities are only things we can physically do, like playing the guitar or riding a bike. But others say that abilities include more abstract things like problem-solving, reasoning, or even virtues like compassion or courage. The question is, where do we draw the line? And what do we mean by 'ability' when we're talking about such different things? Are we talking about the same thing, or are we using the word 'ability' to describe different concepts?","Hmm, I never thought about it that way. But doesn't it get fuzzy when we start talking about things like intelligence or creativity? Are those abilities too?"

Trying to pin down an exact definition of ability can be like trying to grasp a handful of sand – the harder you squeeze, the more it slips away. But if we can get a rough sense of what we mean by 'ability', we might be able to understand the different ways the term is used, and how it relates to other concepts like capacity, skill, and talent. And who knows, we might even discover that our intuitive understanding of ability is more nuanced than we thought.","That makes sense. So, are we trying to come up with a precise definition of ability, or just a rough idea of what we mean?"
"['\n It will be helpful to begin by considering a topic that is related to, but nominally distinct from, abilities: dispositions.\n Dispositions are, at first pass, those properties picked out by predicates like ‘is fragile’ or ‘is soluble’, or alternatively by sentences of the form ‘x is disposed to break when struck’ or ‘x is disposed to dissolve when placed in water.’\xa0Dispositions so understood have figured centrally in the metaphysics and philosophy of science of the last century , and also in influential accounts of the mind . They are like abilities in many significant respects, in particular in the fact that they are properties of things that can exist even when not manifested: as a glass may be fragile even when it is not broken, so may a person have the ability to raise her arm even when she is not raising her arm.\n While dispositions have been central to contemporary philosophical discussions, they do not exhaust the range of the possibilities inherent in things. Especially notable, for present purposes, are those that are intimately connected to agency. These include the susceptibility of things to be acted on in certain ways — such as the edibility of an apple, or the walkability of a trail — that the psychologist J.J. Gibson called affordances .

To explore this idea, let's consider the following analogy: imagine a key and a lock. We would typically say that the key has the ability to unlock the door, but does it make sense to say that the key has an ability independent of the lock's existence? In a sense, the ability is relational, it requires both the key and the lock to function.","Professor, I've been thinking about abilities and how they relate to the natural world.

I'd argue that in cases like the river, we're seeing a manifestation of what philosopher J.J. Gibson called affordances – the river's flow and the stone's properties create an opportunity for erosion. But, we could also view it as an expression of the river's power or disposition to shape its environment.","That makes sense, but what about natural phenomena like a river's ability to carve through stone?

While related, dispositions and powers are distinct. A disposition is more of an intrinsic property of an object, whereas a power or ability is often relational and involves an interaction with the environment. To illustrate, consider a light bulb: it has the disposition to produce light when a certain voltage is applied, but its power or ability to illuminate a room depends on many factors, like the presence of a power source and the environment.","I'm starting to see how these concepts are interconnected.
